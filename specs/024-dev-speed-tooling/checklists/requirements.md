# Specification Quality Checklist: Development Speed — Process and Tooling

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-10-04
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The feature is developer tooling, so its "users" are the maintainer, the coding agent, and build
  runners. Named runners (Vercel, GitHub Actions, Jenkins) are deployment constraints given by the
  maintainer, not implementation choices; tools for the commit check, caches, and test grouping
  are left to planning.
- Time-based criteria use the maintainer machine (20 cores) as the reference.
