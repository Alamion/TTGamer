# Specification Quality Checklist: Configurable trackers

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-09-30
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Requirements and the approved prototype (`prototype.html`, v2) were settled with the maintainer
  on 2026-09-29 and 2026-09-30; no open questions remain.
- Follow-ups recorded in the spec's scope: formulas reading a tracker, no tracker as a list entry
  or table column, a square look for the toggle field.
- Defaults chosen without a question (Assumptions): the new tracker's starting levels, text limits,
  the mapping of built-in marks to today's slash and cross.
